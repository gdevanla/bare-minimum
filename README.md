bare-minimum
============

This is a very simple theme for use with the [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican).  I use this theme for my [blog](http://devanla.com/).

Steps to use the theme:

- Clone the repository

`git clone https://github.com/gdevanla/bare-minimum.git bare-minimum`

- Update your blog's `pelicanconf.py`

`THEME =  <folder to the cloned folder>`

Enjoy!
